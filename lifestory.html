            <p>M 16: Wow, it's been a month since i last wrote on here and OFCOUSE I FGOROG TTO RWRITE ABOUT HAWAII WHILE I STILL REMEMBERED IT , AAAAAAAAAACH. today i did school. one of my friends got me undertale on steam as a birthday preseant and now i am very like the game</p>
            <p>*日 15: MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!! MAY FIFTEENTH, I BECAME OF YEAR 14. I had my birthday party at Adventure Park, from 10 am - 1 pm. My entire grade (which is rpetty small, 15 people) went there, plus 2 cousins and alex, a friend who used to go to my school. Me and Alex decided to, for our first run, go on a black daimond (black hawk iirc) which spent us pretty much the entire time. It started out with a skinny metal ladder we had to climb up, a bit hard, but easy compared to the rest of the course. Next was a thing with a line in the middle bottom with wooden cylinders on theire ides slid tru the whire so that they can role with metal thigns in bretween so they dont move around, and two wires on the top left and top right to hodl onto, weach thing that we were attached eeto was on each top wire, it was ok in difficulty, and u could also kinda cheese it by stepping on the metal things inbetween the wooden rolly things. After that was ... im never gonna finish this and i have hw, ill leave it at this and HOPEFULLY i will continute it, btu i will msot likely forget about it and/or procarastinate abotu doing it</p>

        </p>
        <p>Wed 10, yoo first double digit day in november. no school tmr because of veterans day. I took the AMC 10 today after school at school. Because of daylight savings time, when we finished the test (like 5:00pm) the sun had already set (it was like twilight), and i remember coming out of school and seeing this beautiful orange to pink to purple to violet-blue gradient in the sky, there was like no clouds in the sky which made it even cooler. The moon was like in the first quarter phase and it was like 30-40° above the horizon. There was only one other star in the sky at that time, probably Jupiter or Saturn.</p>
        <p>Tue 9, (do i even need the month it already says it up top, then again if i wanna ctrl+f for a date, i mean i can also just search for th emonth, idk) anyways, today i had school, as usually, but i also got really into <a href="https://blooket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blooket</a> and especially Tower of Doom. It kinda reminds me of Inscryption in a way. Also this interest is probably temporary, as seeing as Tower of Doom has an ending, and all my interests usually end. I also added Blooket to my <a href="aboutme.html">about me page</a>.</p>

        <p>Fri Nov 5, I skipped school to visit another school {ps}, ive visited this school before on an open house but i visited it again and also did a interview in person</p>
