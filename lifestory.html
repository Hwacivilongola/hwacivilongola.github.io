        </p>
        <p>Wed 10, yoo first double digit day in november. no school tmr because of veterans day. I took the AMC 10 today after school at school. Because of daylight savings time, when we finished the test (like 5:00pm) the sun had already set (it was like twilight), and i remember coming out of school and seeing this beautiful orange to pink to purple to violet-blue gradient in the sky, there was like no clouds in the sky which made it even cooler. The moon was like in the first quarter phase and it was like 30-40° above the horizon. There was only one other star in the sky at that time, probably Jupiter or Saturn.</p>
        <p>Tue 9, (do i even need the month it already says it up top, then again if i wanna ctrl+f for a date, i mean i can also just search for th emonth, idk) anyways, today i had school, as usually, but i also got really into <a href="https://blooket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blooket</a> and especially Tower of Doom. It kinda reminds me of Inscryption in a way. Also this interest is probably temporary, as seeing as Tower of Doom has an ending, and all my interests usually end. I also added Blooket to my <a href="aboutme.html">about me page</a>.</p>

        <p>Sat Nov 6, weekend, yay! in the morning i had an online interview for another school {is}, i visited this on a group tour like a few months ago. later that day we celebrated my maternal grandma's birthday. most peopel from my mom's side of the family came over, like 9 people? so my moms 2 siblings and their families. i remember the moon was just a little sliver in the sky. it was fun playing with cousins. also today was daylight savings day</p>
        <p>Fri Nov 5, I skipped school to visit another school {ps}, ive visited this school before on an open house but i visited it again and also did a interview in person</p>
