# Markdown Test!

I'm testing using markdown

## Ooh, fancy h2

Normal text

[le link](AlvinBalvin321.png)

I linked the style.css and it works but why is the text gray and the links this weird light blue...<br>
I think its just the preview im using being weird<br>
cuz like i set color: black in css and now the preview text is black instead of gray<br>
i dont feel like changing the link color tho, maybe ill make it a custom color sometime
