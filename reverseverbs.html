        <h1>Revers Verbs!</h1>
        <p>reverse verbs remind me of subtracting, u can subtract backwards without moving the things. verbs dont have the communitive propertie lke addition and multiplication.</p>
        <p>"i eat apples" and "apples eat me" are very different sentences, this is now also making me think of the old trend (mem, idk what to call it) back in like 2019 (maybe?) where it wwas like, in america i eat apple, (russian accent) and in soviet russia, apple eat i</p>
        <p>anyways ive alsot thought of this as the difference between interviewer and interviewee, where ther -er is the person doing the verb, and the -ee is the one reciving the verb.</p>
        <p>so it'd be a bit like -er [verb]s -ee, and you can see how verbs arent reversable as -ee [verb]s -er doesnt make sense.</p>
